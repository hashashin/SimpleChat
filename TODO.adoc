= Todo

- case matching in categories
- document symbols
- document iscat and ^ (noting that cats must be defined for this) and cat
- loop iterator (done?)
- hashes
- facts (and check subbots work)
- tidy up testbot and parent (and talk about them)
- try to write Shopkeeper and Soldier
- document chat test program (including :event)



== Inherit notes

- "inherit" keyword gets the parent bot from a path, loading if required
- Cats are now searched for up the tree
- Topics are now searched for up the tree.
- Also functions!
- But topic lists are not inherited - you have to put the inherited topics 
into a list for them to work.
- Parent substitutions are also inherited, but you need to insert
"subs parent" where you want them to occur in the subs chain.
