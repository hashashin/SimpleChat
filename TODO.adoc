= Todo

- masses of categories; mods to cat parser: can use cats in other cats before they are declared, tokenizer changes in cat parser
- sort out the pluralisation and make sense of top level cats (what do
 the weird digit suffices in the chatscript data mean?

- "stored patterns"


- hashes
- relations (and check subbots work)
- tidy up testbot and parent (and talk about them)
- try to write Shopkeeper and Soldier
- document chat test program (including :event)





- now use loadBot() to load a bot, which requires a way of getting
a bot's filename, provided by an instance of BotPathProvider().
