= Todo

- masses of categories; mods to cat parser: can use cats in other cats before they are declared, tokenizer changes in cat parser
- sort out the pluralisation and make sense of top level cats (what do
 the weird digit suffices in the chatscript data mean?
 
- global vars: they look like instance vars, but are defined in the 
  globals block and exist only in the bot. Setting an instance var
  overrides them, so the implementation is something like:
   - setting instvars works as currently
   - if getting an instvar fails, fall back to the globals.
   - We actually create a fake "bot instance" to store the data in.

- doc "stored patterns"
- doc maps and ?` !` shortcuts. Map and list commands like get, set and in.
- doc map iteration with `keys`
- doc new string commands

- relations (and check subbots work)
- tidy up testbot and parent (and talk about them)
- try to write Shopkeeper and Soldier
- document chat test program (including :event)





- now use loadBot() to load a bot, which requires a way of getting
a bot's filename, provided by an instance of BotPathProvider().
