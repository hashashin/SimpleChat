= Todo

- pattern parsing with the stream tokeniser
- adding "if/ifnot extension present" compile directive so MC can be 
  stubbed out; also "message" directive(?)
- "stored patterns"
- hashes
- relations (and check subbots work)
- tidy up testbot and parent (and talk about them)
- try to write Shopkeeper and Soldier
- document chat test program (including :event)





- now use loadBot() to load a bot, which requires a way of getting
a bot's filename, provided by an instance of BotPathProvider().
