- doc global vars: they look like instance vars, but are defined in the 
  globals block and exist only in the bot. Setting an instance var
  overrides them, so the implementation is something like:
   - setting instvars works as currently
   - if getting an instvar fails, fall back to the globals.
   - We actually create a fake "bot instance" to store the data in.
  If you *really* want to change global data you can create a map
  in (say) root's globals and use set and get to access that map. Since
  it's always the same map, it's always global.

- doc "stored patterns"
- doc logger
- random code blocks
- lambdas (which can't be persisted, by the way)

- relations (and check subbots work)
- tidy up testbot and parent (and talk about them)
- try to write Shopkeeper and Soldier
- document chat test program (including :event)





- now use loadBot() to load a bot, which requires a way of getting
a bot's filename, provided by an instance of BotPathProvider().
