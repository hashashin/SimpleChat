= Todo

- masses of categories; mods to cat parser: can use cats in other cats before they are declared, tokenizer changes in cat parser
- sort out the pluralisation and make sense of top level cats (what do
 the weird digit suffices in the chatscript data mean?

- doc "stored patterns"
- doc maps and ?` !` shortcuts. Map and list commands like get, set and in.
- doc map iteration with `keys`
- doc new string commands

- better "articlisation" so that "seeds" -> some seeds, and mass nouns
  are dealt with. This is messy and requires a corpus, perhaps a 
  "special cat" we can set up.
  

- relations (and check subbots work)
- tidy up testbot and parent (and talk about them)
- try to write Shopkeeper and Soldier
- document chat test program (including :event)





- now use loadBot() to load a bot, which requires a way of getting
a bot's filename, provided by an instance of BotPathProvider().
